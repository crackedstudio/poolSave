# PoolSave — Community Rotating Savings With Collective Yield Allocation

## Inspiration
Across Africa and Latin America, rotating savings circles — *ajo, esusu, tontines, juntas* — have helped communities reach financial goals for decades.

They work because of trust and discipline, but they also face challenges:

- Funds earn no yield during the cycle  
- Manual bookkeeping leads to errors  
- High risk of fraud or mismanagement  
- Hard to coordinate across distances  
- No transparent record of who receives payouts  

PoolSave brings this cultural tradition into the digital age using blockchain — adding automation, transparency, and yield generation while keeping the community spirit intact.

## What We Built
**PoolSave is a decentralized group-savings platform that upgrades traditional rotating savings with pooled yields and member voting for payout selection.**

- Members deposit stablecoins into shared pools  
- Funds are deployed into yield-generating strategies  
- At the end of each cycle:  
  - Principal stays intact  
  - Only the yield is distributed  
  - Members vote to select the beneficiary  

This mirrors traditional systems while improving fairness and efficiency.

## Core Features
- On-chain savings pool  
- Automated contribution tracking  
- Pooled yield for higher returns  
- **Member voting** to decide who receives yield each cycle  
- Fully transparent contribution and payout history  
- Optional lock-in periods  
- Mobile-first UX for accessibility  

---

## How It Works
Each pool has **N** members contributing a fixed amount.

Let:  
- **P** = total pooled principal  
- **r** = yield generated in the cycle  

Cycle reward:

\[
\text{Cycle Reward} = r \times P
\]

Members vote on who receives the reward.  
The cycle resets, principal remains untouched, and yield continues to compound.

## How We Built It
PoolSave is powered by blockchain-based smart contracts that handle:

- Deposits & withdrawals  
- Membership logic  
- Contribution accounting  
- Yield accumulation  
- Secure voting & payout execution  

A backend monitors on-chain events, while a mobile interface simplifies user onboarding.

## Challenges
- Designing a fair and culturally familiar voting system  
- Handling large member pools efficiently  
- Making UX simple for non-crypto users  
- Ensuring transparency without compromising safety  

---

## What We Learned
- Blending cultural finance with decentralized technology  
- Designing intuitive mobile-first crypto experiences  
- Implementing group coordination logic on-chain  
- Supporting financial discipline with contract-enforced rules  

---

## Vision
PoolSave becomes the **global digital version of ajo/esusu/tontines**:

- Communities save together  
- Trust becomes transparency  
- Yield is pooled and distributed fairly  
- Members collectively decide beneficiaries  
- Saving becomes automated, safe, and rewarding

## Choosing the Right Blockchain (TBD)
PoolSave requires:

- Low fees  
- Scalability  
- High security  
- Easy onboarding  
- Friendly developer tooling  
- Accessible on/off-ramps  

Final network selection is **TBD**, and will be based on user needs across Africa and LATAM.
